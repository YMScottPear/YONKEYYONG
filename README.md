# YonkeyYong
 Submission to MacEwan October 2023 Hackathon!
 
 Submitted by: Scott Pearson (Year 2), Stephanie Kinsella (Year 1), and Amber Gogan (Year 1)

This program is a ressurection of the original 'Donkey Kong' arcade brought back to life using pygame.
To fit the theme of the hackathon, we resurrected an old software using modern tools.

This game has you as 'Mr.Skele', and you must try to save your hot ghost girlfriend, 'Ghosty', from the infamous Yonkey Yong.

This game is an arcade-style platformer with the purpse of getting as high of score as you can.

To run the game, run the YonkeyYong.exe file :)

The year 1 students helped contribute to this project by: providing assets, including most pixel art you see in the program.
They also helped create some simple functions, including the 'update_highscore()' function. The year 1s also greatly helped create ideas, and organize thoughts during the making of this program.
