# YonkeyYong
 Submission to MacEwan October 2023 Hackathon!
 
 Submitted by: Scott Pearson, Stephanie Kinsella, and Amber Gogan

This program is a ressurection of the original 'Donkey Kong' arcade brought back to life using pygame.
To fit the theme of the hackathon, we resurrected an old software using modern tools.

This game has you as 'Mr.Skele', and you must try to save your hot ghost girlfriend, 'Ghosty', from the infamous Yonkey Yong.

This game is an arcade-style platformer with the purpse of getting as high of score as you can.

To run the game, run the YonkeyYong.exe file :)
